---

**Important Considerations for Deliverables:**

* **Audience Tailoring:** Executive summaries and roadmaps are for leadership. Detailed diagrams and technical specifications are for development teams.
* **Visuals are Key:** EA is about communicating complex concepts simply. Use clear, standardized diagrams (e.g., ArchiMate, UML, BPMN) consistently.
* **Iterative Nature:** EA deliverables are not static. They should be living documents that are updated as the architecture evolves.
* **Collaboration:** EA deliverables are rarely created in a vacuum. They are the result of collaboration with business stakeholders, IT teams, and subject matter experts.
