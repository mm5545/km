Absolutely, this is a critical distinction and relationship! The answer is a strong YES, a Knowledge Management (KM) strategy for a multinational bank should definitely be underpinned by an Information Strategy, or at the very least, be tightly integrated with existing Information Management (IM) principles and frameworks.
Here's why and how they relate:
Understanding the Relationship: Information vs. Knowledge
Let's clarify the hierarchy, as often these terms are used interchangeably:
 * Data: Raw, unorganized facts and figures. (e.g., a number, a word, a date)
 * Information: Data that has been processed, organized, and structured to provide context and meaning. (e.g., a customer's name, address, and account balance compiled into a customer profile)
 * Knowledge: Information combined with experience, insights, context, and interpretation, leading to understanding and the ability to act or make decisions. It exists in both explicit (codified, documented) and tacit (in people's heads, learned through experience) forms.
Information Management (IM) primarily deals with the systematic management of an organization's information assets. This includes:
 * Information Architecture: How information is structured, classified, and tagged (taxonomies, metadata).
 * Content Management: How content is created, stored, published, and archived.
 * Data Governance: Policies and processes for data quality, security, privacy, and retention.
 * Systems & Repositories: The platforms where information resides (databases, document management systems like SharePoint, wikis like Confluence).
 * Access & Security: Ensuring information is available to the right people while protected from unauthorized access.
Knowledge Management (KM) builds upon IM. While IM focuses on the information itself and its systematic handling, KM focuses on leveraging that information, combined with human expertise and insights, to drive business value. KM is about:
 * Capturing Tacit Knowledge: Turning "know-how" into "know-what" and "know-how-to-do-it."
 * Sharing & Collaboration: Facilitating the flow of knowledge between individuals and teams.
 * Applying Knowledge: Ensuring knowledge is used to make better decisions, solve problems, and innovate.
 * Fostering a Knowledge Culture: Encouraging learning, sharing, and continuous improvement.
 * Expert Identification: Connecting people to the right expertise.
Why KM Strategy Needs IM Underpinnings
 * Foundation for Findability: Your pain point "difficulty finding right information" directly relies on strong IM. Without proper information architecture (tagging, classification, consistent metadata), even the best KM tools will struggle to make knowledge discoverable. An IM strategy would define these standards.
 * Reliability & Trust: If the underlying information is messy, inaccurate, or outdated (poor IM), the knowledge derived from it will be unreliable. A robust IM strategy ensures data quality and content integrity, building trust in the KM system.
 * Compliance & Security: Especially in a bank, IM directly addresses regulatory requirements like GDPR and local financial regulations regarding data privacy, retention, and access control. KM needs to operate within these IM-defined guardrails. You can't share knowledge that isn't compliant with retention or privacy rules.
 * Leveraging Existing Investments: Your bank already has SharePoint and Confluence. An IM strategy would define how these platforms fit into the broader information ecosystem, ensuring they are used effectively and their content is managed consistently, rather than just being unorganized dumps of documents.
 * Efficiency & Scalability: A well-defined IM strategy prevents duplication, ensures consistency, and provides a scalable framework for managing the sheer volume of information in a multinational bank. This efficiency directly impacts the effectiveness of KM efforts.
 * "One Version of the Truth": IM aims for canonical sources of information. This is vital for KM to ensure that "best practices," "policies," and "blueprints" are indeed the approved, most current versions.
As an Enterprise Architect, your role in bridging them:
As the Enterprise Architect, you are perfectly positioned to ensure this crucial linkage. Your KM strategy won't just say "we need to share knowledge better"; it will specify how that sharing is enabled by:
 * A solid Information Architecture: What are the global taxonomies, metadata standards, and content models that will make knowledge findable across SharePoint and Confluence? This is an IM deliverable.
 * Clear Content Governance: Who is responsible for the quality and currency of specific information assets (IM), which then underpins their value as knowledge (KM)?
 * Integrated Technology Stack: How do SharePoint and Confluence integrate to provide a seamless knowledge experience, and what IM tools (like enterprise search, data classification tools) are needed to make them work together?
 * Defined Data Retention & Compliance Rules: How will knowledge lifecycle be managed to meet legal and regulatory obligations?
Therefore, your Knowledge Management Strategy should either explicitly include core components of an Information Strategy, or it should clearly state its dependencies on and alignment with an existing, robust Information Strategy. For a multinational bank, it's virtually impossible to build an effective KM strategy without those strong IM foundations.
Does that clarify why this underpinning is so vital?
