# **EA KM Strategy Delivery Pack**

This pack represents the core deliverables an EA would produce to formally present and drive the KM strategy.

1.  **Executive Summary (The "Elevator Pitch")**
    * **Purpose:** A concise, high-level overview of the KM strategy, its objectives, benefits, and key components for senior leadership.
    * **Format:** 1-2 pages, often presented as the first section of the main strategy document.

2.  **KM Strategy Document (The "Blueprint")**
    * **Purpose:** The core document detailing the what, why, and how of the KM strategy. This will incorporate all the insights we've discussed.
    * **Format:** Formal document (e.g., PDF or dedicated internal webpage) with clear sections.
    * **Key Sections (as discussed):**
        * Introduction & Strategic Imperatives (Pain points, Business Objectives)
        * Current State Analysis (As-Is - High-level summary of SharePoint/Confluence, culture, silos)
        * Future State Vision (To-Be - Your chosen strategy, e.g., "Connected Ecosystem")
        * Strategic Pillars/Initiatives (The "How" - e.g., Information Architecture, Technology Roadmap, Culture & Change Management, Governance Framework)
        * Targeted Outcomes & Success Metrics (KPIs, linked to business value)
        * High-Level Technology Roadmap (Leveraging current tech, identifying gaps)
        * Governance Framework (Your proposed multi-layered structure)
        * Implementation Phasing / Roadmap (High-level timeline and milestones)
        * Risk Assessment & Mitigation

3.  **Current State ("As-Is") Architecture Diagram(s)**
    * **Purpose:** Visually represent the current fragmented state of knowledge, highlighting silos and pain points.
    * **Format:** High-level block diagrams. Could include a simplified version of our "Knowledge Ecosystem" showing *disconnection*.
    * **Content:** Current platforms (SharePoint, Confluence), major knowledge domains, current user experience (difficulty finding info, experts).

4.  **Future State ("To-Be") Architecture Diagram(s)**
    * **Purpose:** Visually depict the target state of the KM ecosystem, showing integrations and desired flows.
    * **Format:** High-level block diagrams. Our "Knowledge Ecosystem" diagram or similar.
    * **Content:** Integrated platforms, unified search, expert directory, content lifecycle, governance layers.

5.  **KM Governance Framework Document/Diagram**
    * **Purpose:** Detail the roles, responsibilities, processes, and decision-making bodies for KM.
    * **Format:** Dedicated section in the strategy document, or a standalone annex/diagram.
    * **Content:** KM Steering Committee, IT/Tech governance, Content Ownership model, Compliance oversight. Your "Compliance & Governance Overlay" ASCII diagram could be a great visual.

6.  **High-Level Implementation Roadmap / Phasing**
    * **Purpose:** Provide a conceptual timeline for how the strategy will be realized, identifying key phases and major milestones.
    * **Format:** Gantt chart (simplified), swimlane diagram, or phased bullet points.
    * **Content:** Discovery & Detailed Design, Platform Enhancement/Integration, Content Migration/Curation, Pilot Programs, Rollout by Region/Department, Training, Ongoing Measurement & Optimization.

7.  **Stakeholder Engagement Plan**
    * **Purpose:** Outline who needs to be involved, their roles, and how they will be engaged throughout the strategy development and implementation.
    * **Format:** Table or matrix.
    * **Content:** Key stakeholders (Exec Sponsors, Business Unit Heads, IT Leads, Compliance, Legal, HR, etc.), their interest level, influence, and engagement approach (e.g., workshops, interviews, review sessions).

8.  **Benefits Realization & KPI Dashboard Template**
    * **Purpose:** A framework for how the success of the KM strategy will be measured and tracked over time. Addresses your need for KPIs.
    * **Format:** Spreadsheet template or conceptual dashboard design.
    * **Content:** Defined KPIs, measurement methodology, data sources, reporting frequency, target values.

### **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to Produce the KM Strategy**

This is a high-level WBS, indicating the major phases and key activities. Remember, reverse planning applies here â€“ start from the desired deliverables!

**Phase 1: Discovery & Current State Analysis (As-Is)**
* 1.1 Kick-off & Project Charter Confirmation
    * 1.1.1 Confirm Scope, Objectives, and Initial Success Factors
    * 1.1.2 Identify Core Project Team & Key Stakeholders
* 1.2 Stakeholder Interviews & Workshops
    * 1.2.1 Conduct interviews with key business leaders (e.g., heads of compliance, operations, product development)
    * 1.2.2 Facilitate workshops with end-users and content owners to capture pain points, current practices, and unmet needs.
* 1.3 Technology Landscape Assessment
    * 1.3.1 Analyze existing SharePoint and Confluence environments (usage, content types, structure)
    * 1.3.2 Identify other relevant systems (e.g., CRM, HR systems, data lakes) that might hold critical knowledge.
